- Make sure photos are properly oriented (not upside down)
- Compress images for web (under 500KB each for faster loading)

### **Photo Suggestions:**
1. **Hero Photo**: A close-up portrait with good lighting
2. **First Date**: A photo from when you first met or your first date
3. **Special Moment**: A romantic or memorable moment together
4. **Adventure**: A photo from a trip, outing, or adventure
5. **Recent**: A recent photo showing how beautiful she is now

### **How to Add Photos:**
1. Save your photos in this `images` folder
2. Name them exactly as specified above
3. The website will automatically display them
4. If a photo doesn't load, the placeholder will show instead

### **Fallback:**
If you don't have all the photos, the website will still work perfectly with the beautiful placeholder designs. You can add photos later anytime!
